# Zero-the-Hero
Brief project description:
It is a 2 player housie game developed using java with more than 3 levels. 
Most housie games available online lack the added functionality of ticket selection which has been carefully added into the game developed here.
The project starts with a player ticket design screen on the basis of he number of players who wish to play the game. The user then gets a chance to design his/her own tickets.
After the selection/designing is done, the randomize function operates calling the numbers and the user tickets are then checked for that number. If there's a match, the number is striked off and the tickets are displayed after every subsequent round.
Depending upon the pattern tarced by the striked off numbers, the player is entitled to awards and the game continues. 

Future Scope or Expansion:
This game can be scaled up in order to allow many more users use the game for recreational purposes.
The game could be made web based and database could be deployed to keep a track of the player's winnings and track record.
The gamers could collaborate with fellow gamers and play league championships.
